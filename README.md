# Something Awesome Crypter
A security project for COMP6841 UNSW

This project is about building a program that is able to use encryption to bypass antivirus protection. This is for educational purposes as it shows those who are interested how hackers are able to use encryption to their advantage in enabling their activities.

The project is written in C#

Disclaimer: This is just a demonstration project to help educate people on how encryption can be adapted for criminal use. I do not condone the use of this project for malicious intent and ask to please be responsible. I am not responsible for the misuse of this project.
